# Introduction
Many teachers feel like they are not given the resources required to effectively teach a classroom of students.  

Many feel like they are short on time and so cannot properly prepare for lessons...  

On the topic of time, they also feel the amount of work required to be done in the evenings (like marking homework or exam papers) is too much, and this is causing fatigue and no work-life balance.  
There are many AI productivity tools that can help, and many schools are now starting to use them to assist teachers do a better job.  

# Opportunity
But a startling statistic published by the Guardian tells us that perhaps an overlooked area when it comes to education reform is kids with needs and disabilities:

**Schools 'failing to diagnose at least 80% of dyslexic pupils'**

In steps Lexplore Analytics, one tool that can help identify students with needs that may require additional help and attention.

# Benefits: How does the tool work:
- Eye-tracking technology that can assess reading ability and identify dyslexia. Can detect minor differences in eye movement patterns, which can indicate how the brain processes text.  
- AI Analysis that provides detailed insights to help teachers tailor their instructions to meet individual needs. Data collected is analyzed using AI algorithms. Using the data, it can determine a child’s reading ability in just 3-5 minutes, providing objective real-time data, that helps identify students.

# Risks:
- The obvious risk is the safety of student data.
    - Lexplore takes security very seriously.  
    Here are a few measures they have taken:
    - Double encryption with key management outside of the infrastructure.
    - Two-step verification.
    - The login is done with multifactor authentication and all traffic is encrypted.
    - They also have a Data Protection Officer, as prescribed by law, that can answer any questions related to data and security.
  
- Potential worry is the accuracy of the AI technology.  
    - But you can be confident and trust the results as there is proof that there is a positive impact across many schools that have used it.  
    For example, this is a statistic of the city of Lidingö since the introduction of this technology across many educational institutions.

# Evaluation:
**'Schools failing to diagnose at least 80% of dyslexic pupils'**

- This tool by no means solves all the problems teachers are facing with students that have special needs.  
- But with dyslexia, it provides a way for schools and teachers to identify early on if that student suffers from it, and provides steps and actions to teachers and parents to help tailor their teaching to fit the student.  
- This means teachers can prepare ahead of time and know exactly which student requires different/additional help, which is also something that Lexplore provides.
